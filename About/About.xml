	<description>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Props and Decor is a major mod release that has been in production for almost 8 months. The main aim is to provide much needed customizability to your bases and cities, a way to add some detail to your rooms and buildings, and to generally allow you to place more of “you” inside the game.

This mod adds almost 350 hand drawn, vanilla-like props, spread across several categories, from place-able filth to space ships. All these props have no functionality in the game - a sink prop doesn’t use Dubs Bad Hygiene, a shelf prop isn’t an actual shelf, and it doesn’t need Deep Storage to work. All these props are simply decorations, and to reward players for placing them, they each provide 1 Beauty - which means they slightly level the beauty rating of the room they are in.

Why didn’t we add functionality to these props? Because of the sheer amount of them - I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t add function to ALL of them. I wouldn’t be satisfied with just 30 props with functions while the rest would just be props. I have then decided all of those should be simply props, as the name of the mod suggests.

Well don’t wait any longer, download this mod, use the new props to decorate your base and make sure to tell your friends about it too! Everyone wants to place a puddle of vomit in their hospitals!
